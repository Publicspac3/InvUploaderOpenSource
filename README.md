# InvUploaderOpenSource
Barebones .cpp and .h files for our InvUploader plugin that automatically uploads inventories. 

Heres how I suggest using it:
1. Download these files
2. Download Martinn's Plugin template [Here](https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplate).
3. Put these files into your plugin, and edit as you need.
