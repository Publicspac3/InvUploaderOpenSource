# InvUploaderOpenSource
Barebones .cpp and .h files for our InvUploader plugin that automatically uploads inventories. 

Heres how I suggest using it:
1. download these files
2. download Martinn's Plugin template [Here](https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplate)
3. put these files into the template, and edit as you please
